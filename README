BeagleBone Black project where I controlled some blinds via DC motor. It could open and close blinds remotely through a website, as well as allow for the user to set a time for opening or closing it.

A website hosted on a Heroku server allows a user to send commands to the BeagleBone remotely. The beaglebone uses node.js. BeagleBone sends GPIO commands to a H bridge, controlling a motor.

Template and instructions that I used to start out with: http://www.ariunjargal.com/blog/beaglebone-cloud/
Files that I altered and worked on: index.html and server.js (in mobile), server.js (in mobile2)

If you make any changes to these files (in mobile): index.html, server.js, package.json
then run these commands on your beaglebone:
git add .
git commit -m "init"
git push heroku master
