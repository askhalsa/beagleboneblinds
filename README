BeagleBone Black project where I controlled some blinds via DC motor. It could open and close blinds remotely through a website, as well as allow for the user to set a time for opening or closing it.

A website hosted on a Heroku server allows a user to send commands to the BeagleBone remotely. The beaglebone uses node.js. BeagleBone sends GPIO commands to a H bridge, controlling a motor.
